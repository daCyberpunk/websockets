# websockets
TYPO3 Extension key websockets from TER (Its outdated and non working there) made working for TYPO3 7.6

Just install Extension and create scheduler task. You will see it running in browsers console. tests were made through Classes/Connectiontest.php

I am not actively working on this but you are welcome to do so.
